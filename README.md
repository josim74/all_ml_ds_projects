# Movie Recommendation System

Recommendation algorithms help us make decisions by learning our preference. There are two main types of recommendation algorithms-
  1. Content Based: Recommends movies based on other people liked.
  2. Collaborative: Recommends movies based on own interest.

LightFM is a great library for getting started with recommendations uses the Content based and Collaborative both called hybrid.
