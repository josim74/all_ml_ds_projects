# Sentiment Analysis

1. Sentiment Analysis: Understanding and extracting the feelings from data.

2. API: An API lets you access apps functionality and data from your code. I have used Twitter API to get public posts from Twitter.

3. TextBlob: An awesome library for NLP tasks. This will tokenize all the text then find the words that related to positive or negative then provides negative or positive value of polarity. So that we can understand the the feelings of that post.
